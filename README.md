## GB Emulator in progress
Using SDL2 and g++, but any C++ compiler should work.

Far from working in any shape or form.

Needs to be manually added after cloning repo
- lib/SDL2
- lib/SDL2_image
- include/SDL2
- include/SDL2_image

I will probably try to do some kind of submodule linking in the future, but at the moment it's not fully setup.
